The pig is a circle in the center, dots around this space may contain treasure and you need to find it. The position of the pig and the treasure is always different, the plane is set from 0 to 100 in x and y.  Next, the excavations begin. The pig is on top where nothing threatens her, but below in different places there are 4 bombs and only one cell is a treasure that needs to be dug up.
